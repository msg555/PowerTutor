ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* LICENCE
* Makefile
* README
* android-9.jar
* debug.keystore
* default.properties

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => PowerTutor2/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => PowerTutor2/src/main/jni/
* libs/achartengine-1.0.0.jar => PowerTutor2/libs/achartengine-1.0.0.jar
* res/ => PowerTutor2/src/main/res/
* src/ => PowerTutor2/src/main/java/
* src/edu/umich/PowerTutor/PowerNotifications.aidl => PowerTutor2/src/main/aidl/edu/umich/PowerTutor/PowerNotifications.aidl
* src/edu/umich/PowerTutor/service/ICounterService.aidl => PowerTutor2/src/main/aidl/edu/umich/PowerTutor/service/ICounterService.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
